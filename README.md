## 🚀 About the Project

The purpose of this project is to gain insights from the dataset by applying various analytical methods, such as data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. Key questions the project aims to answer include:

- What are the most popular genres on Netflix?

- How have Netflix movies evolved over the years?

- Are there any significant patterns between movie ratings and release years?

- What is the distribution of movie durations across different genres?



### Key Objectives:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the Netflix movie dataset.
  
- Analyzing trends in movie releases over time.
  
- Identifying changes in movie genres, ratings, and durations throughout the years.
  
## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Pandas** → Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** → Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Data analysis and documentation.

## 📈 Data Analysis Tasks
Perform exploratory data analysis on the netflix_data.csv data to understand more about movies from the 1990s decade.

1. What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called duration (use 1990 as the decade's start year).

2. A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes. Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save this integer as short_movie_count.
